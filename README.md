Debunked: Urban Legends Revealed
========

The first and only app for easily browsing all of the rumors and urban legends from Snopes on your iOS device.

Debunked was hastily thrown together during a week of furious coding. It was my guinea pig project to learn Objective-C and Cocoa on iOS. I cannot in good conscience recommend this project as an example of how to do _anything_.

Debunked is no longer available on the Apple App Store. However, you are free to download a copy of the source, compile, and run it for yourself. It compiles on Xcode 4.6.1. Other versions of Xcode may or may not work.
